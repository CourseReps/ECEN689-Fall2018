    "## Activity 4 (Part 1): Wine Quality Linear Regression\n",
    "Due: October 16, 2018\n",
    "\n",
    "Activity 4 is based on the [Wine Quality Data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality), which aggregates objective tests about various wines.\n",
    "The output is based on sensory data (median of at least 3 evaluations made by wine experts).\n",
    "Each expert graded wine quality between 0 (bad) and 10 (excellent).\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this activity is to explore a linear regression to predict wine quality.\n",

    "### Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression is a statistical approach to modelling the relationship between a scalar response (or dependent variable) and one or more explanatory variables (or independent variables).\n",
    "In this framework, the relationships between input and output are modeled using linear predictor functions whose unknown model parameters are estimated from the data.\n",

    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "This challenge uses a combined and cleaned up version of `winequality-red.csv` and `winequality-white.csv`.\n",
    "The 11 input variables are as follows.\n",

    "### Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "The root-mean-square error (RMSE) is a frequently used criterion of the differences between predicted values (sample or population values) predicted by a model or an estimator and the values observed. The RMSD represents the square root of the second sample moment of the differences between predicted values and observed values or the quadratic mean of these differences.\n",

Each observation is called an instance and the class it belongs to is the label.
