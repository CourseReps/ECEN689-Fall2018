## Files
- README.md: This file.
- 2challenge_logreg.csv: Contains predictions for MNIST testing data from logistic regression. Each row represents a test image. Columns are `Id`, `Category`.
- 2challenge_logreg_vectors.csv: Contains logistic regression output vectors. Columns are `Category`, `pixel0`, `pixel1`, ... `pixel783`.  
- 2challenge_knn.csv: Contains predictions for MNIST testing data from k-nearest neighbors. Each row represents a test image. Columns are `Id`, `Category`.

## Code
- Logistic Regression: Code for fitting and predicting with logistic regression can be found at `../../../Students/blthayer/challenge_2.py`
  - NOTE: Adjust paths in the `# FILES` portion of the code. Data should be downloaded from class Kaggle challenge.
- K-Nearest Neighbors: TODO. Code is complete, but not pushed to GitHub yet.
  - Code should be found at `../../../Students/kishan3111/challenge2.ipynb`
