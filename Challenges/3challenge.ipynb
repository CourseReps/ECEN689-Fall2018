    "Activity 3 is based on the [World Bank Data](https://www.kaggle.com/gemartin/world-bank-data-1960-to-2016), which aggregates countries population, fertility rate, and life expectancy from 1960 to 2016.\n",
    "The goal of this activity is to explore a regression analysis method that perform both variable selection and regularization in order to enhance the prediction accuracy and limit the fragility of a statistical model.\n",
    "Relevant topics for this challenge include the following section.\n",
    " * Linear Regression (Section 9.2)\n",
    " * Regularized Loss Minimization (Section 13.1)\n",
    " * Stable Rules Do Not Overfit (Section 13.2)\n",
