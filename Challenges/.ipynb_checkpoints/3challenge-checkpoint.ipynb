    "\n",
    "### [Kaggle Tutorials](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview)\n",

    "## Activity 3: World Bank Data\n",
    "Due: October 2, 2018\n",
    "~~September 27, 2018~~\n",
    "\n",
    "Activity 3 is based on the [World Bank Data](https://www.kaggle.com/gemartin/world-bank-data-1960-to-2016), which aggregates the population of various countries, along with fertility rate and life expectancy, from 1960 to 2016.\n",
    "The goal of this activity is to explore a regression analysis method that performs both variable selection and regularization in order to enhance the prediction accuracy and limit the fragility of a statistical model.\n",
    "Relevant topics for this challenge include the following sections.\n",
    " * Linear Regression (Section 9.2)\n",
    " * Regularized Loss Minimization (Section 13.1)\n",
    " * Stable Rules Do Not Overfit (Section 13.2)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Least Squares\n",
    "\n",
    "The method of least squares is a standard approach in regression analysis to approximate the solution of overdetermined systems.\n",
    "This technique is used extensively in the context of data fitting; the best fit in the least-squares sense minimizes the sum of squared residuals.\n",
    "In the current context, a regularized version to the least squares solution is highly desirable.\n",
    "Ridge regression, or Tikhonov regularization, adds the constraint that the $L_2$-norm of the parameter vector remains no greater than a given value.\n",
    "An alternative regularized version of least squares is Lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator), which uses the constraint that the $L_1$-norm of the parameter vector be no greater than a given value.\n",
    "The latter constraint, which we will focus on, favors sparsity in the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, the data we are using is based on the [World Bank Data](https://www.kaggle.com/gemartin/world-bank-data-1960-to-2016).\n",
    "Specifically, we are using a cleaned up version of `country_population.csv` where incomplete rows have been removed and extraneous columns have been deleted.\n",
    "The intent is to use year 1960 to 1999 to train a least squares model and, subsequently, explore its prediction power for year 2001 to 2016.\n",
    "For a given country, the solution should be a population estimate based on a linear combination of (at most) five other countries.\n",
    "Mathematically, the population of country $C_0$ is estimated based on the population of five other countries,\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\hat{C}_0(\\text{year}) = \\sum_i \\alpha_i C_i(\\text{year})\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "subject to $\\| \\boldsymbol{\\alpha} \\|_0 \\leq 5$.\n",
    "For every country, the parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$ must be derived based on populations from 1960 to 1999.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation criterion is the average sum of squared residuals for populations from 2000 to 2016.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### File Descriptions\n",
    "\n",
