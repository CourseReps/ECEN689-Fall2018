    "The goal of this project is to support or refute the claim: income level is positively correlated to health.\n",
    "Pertinent well-being indicators may include diabetes and obesity rates, although the teams are encouraged to be creative about information sources.\n",
    "Public data sets are identified, and they should be viewed as a starting point.\n",
