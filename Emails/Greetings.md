Greetings,

I would like to welcome you to campus. You are receiving this message because you are currently registered for ECEN 689-606, Applied Information Science. Sessions are scheduled to take place on Tuesday and Thursday from 5:30 pm to 6:45 pm in ETB 1037. There is no required book for this course. Instead, we will use Internet resources, reading assignments, and notes. This is a project-based learning course and, as such, it is likely to differ from many other graduate courses, both in content and format. To get the most out of this experience, you should complete the tasks, challenges, assignments before their corresponding deadline. Also, to help you with the discipline that this requires, you may be quizzed on the material from time to time. You will also have to turn your computing device into a world-class programming platform, using open software; and you should bring your device with you to every session (if possible).

You will find a copy of the syllabus on the Google Drive.

Best regards,
Jean-Francois Chamberland
