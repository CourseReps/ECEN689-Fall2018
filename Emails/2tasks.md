Students:

This email pertains to Tasks 3 and 4, which you should complete by Thursday, August 30.
Task 3 focuses on building a programming environment to support projects.
Once you have completed Task 2, and in particular the installation of Anaconda, you get Jupyter for free.
Still, it is well invested time to familiarize yourself with this environment.
It runs within a browser tab in a elegant, simple fashion. Watch the YouTube video below.

An interesting aspect of the Jypyter interface is that it is very similar to the interface one gets from Google Colaboratory and TensorFlow, which will likely emerge as a later tasks.
As a preview, watch the YouTube video below.

The second programming environment, PyCharm by JetBrains, is a full-fledged professional IDE that you get for free under an academic license.
Interestingly, Android Studio is based on the same framework.
As such, it may be of particular interest to those also inclined to do mobile programming (which we will NOT do in this course).
If you are a coding ninja, then you may elect to program more advanced project within the workflow you are already using.

Task 4 introduces you to basic Python modules. I should probably throw Scikit-Learn in the mix.
