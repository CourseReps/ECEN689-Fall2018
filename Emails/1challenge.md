	ECEN689-Fall2018 -> Challenges -> 1challenge.ipynb

This challenge includes assigned readings, short online courses, and a brief activity.
To complete the activity, copy the Jupyter notebook to your own student directory under ```1challenge.ipynb```, change ```'netid'``` to your NetId, alter the path to ```('../Challenges/1Files/' + filename)```, and edit the file to perform the task.
The mean and variance should be changed in place.
This is an individual challenge, but exchanging with other students is allowed.

Commit and Push your changes to ```'1challenge1activity_' + student_identity + '.csv'``` by Thusday, September 6, 2018, for full consideration.

Best regards,

Jean-Francois Chamberland
