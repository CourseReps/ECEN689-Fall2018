# Evaluation Rubric for Projects

* __Problem Formulation__: The problem formulation is described clearly; it is meaningful and mathematically sound. The report includes necessary background material to provide an adequate description of the problem formulation.
* __Analysis__: The project report provides an accurate analysis of the proposed solution. Evaluation criteria for prospective implementations are well motivated and described adequately. Performance results are convincing.
* __Originality__: The project demonstrates significant evidence of originality and inventiveness. Prior art is given credit through references. Rational explanation or intuition for selected approached is provided.
* __Organization__: The report is well structured and the organization facilitates the flow of ideas. Information is organized in a logical manner, establishing a natural progression from the problem statement to the proposed solution and ensuing analysis.
* __Presentation__: Ideas are conveyed clearly, with proper writing. Concepts are supported adequately with explanations. Covers engineering solution and its impli- cation with sufficient details. Content is support with diagrams and figures wherever appropriate.



# Critique:

* Problem Formulation:

Is the final project a given problem, or a problem the team has to solve?

* For analysis:
provide a high-level rubric (not required to be exact since methodologies will differ between teams)

* For originality:
Explain how the team's original work could be beneficial. 

*  For Organizations:
Documenting the project through code comments, and technical reports.

*  For presentations:
no blocks of text. Presentation is rich in visuals. The presentation contains headlines without too much details.
