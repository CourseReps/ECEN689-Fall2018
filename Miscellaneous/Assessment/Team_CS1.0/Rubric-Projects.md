# Evaluation Rubric for Projects

* __Problem Formulation__: The problem formulation is described clearly; it is meaningful and mathematically sound. The report includes necessary background material to provide an adequate description of the problem formulation.
* __Analysis__: The project report provides an accurate analysis of the proposed solution. Evaluation criteria for prospective implementations are well motivated and described adequately. Performance results are convincing.
* __Originality__: The project demonstrates significant evidence of originality and inventiveness. Prior art is given credit through references. Rational explanation or intuition for selected approached is provided.
* __Organization__: The report is well structured and the organization facilitates the flow of ideas. Information is organized in a logical manner, establishing a natural progression from the problem statement to the proposed solution and ensuing analysis.
* __Presentation__: Ideas are conveyed clearly, with proper writing. Concepts are supported adequately with explanations. Covers engineering solution and its impli- cation with sufficient details. Content is support with diagrams and figures wherever appropriate.

#Critique
* Teams should focus more on real life problems and then comparison should be done between their solution and state of art solution
* Alternatives which are possible to implement but team was restricted due to time frame or computational power
* How the solution can be implemented in different domains? If yes, then what modifications are necessary
