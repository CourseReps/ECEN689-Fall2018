# Evaluation Rubric for Projects

* __Problem Formulation__: The problem formulation is described clearly; it is meaningful and mathematically sound. The report includes necessary background material to provide an adequate description of the problem formulation.
* __Analysis__: The project report provides an accurate analysis of the proposed solution. Evaluation criteria for prospective implementations are well motivated and described adequately. Performance results are convincing.
* __Originality__: The project demonstrates significant evidence of originality and inventiveness. Prior art is given credit through references. Rational explanation or intuition for selected approached is provided.
* __Organization__: The report is well structured and the organization facilitates the flow of ideas. Information is organized in a logical manner, establishing a natural progression from the problem statement to the proposed solution and ensuing analysis.
* __Presentation__: Ideas are conveyed clearly, with proper writing. Concepts are supported adequately with explanations. Covers engineering solution and its impli- cation with sufficient details. Content is support with diagrams and figures wherever appropriate.
* __Level of Difficulty__: If someone tries new with difficult dataset, we think an extra credit can be given for that
* __Effort into consideration__: Often research problems may not see expected outcomes despite good effort. It may extend beyond the semester. Can efforts be given credits?
