# Applied Information Science

This multidisciplinary project-based laboratory course provides instruction on extracting information from data through hands-on activities that complement traditional classroom experience.
Topics include predictive modeling, regression and classification; data cleaning and preprocessing; feature engineering and selection; entropy, information theory, and learning.
This course focuses on applications and involves working with real data.
It leverages an array of tools including [Git](http://git-scm.com/), [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/), [Python](https://www.python.org/), [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/), [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/), and [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).
The focus is on modular projects, algorithms and implementation, data management, and visualization.
In addition, emphasis is put on team work, presentation skills, time management, creativity, and innovation. 


## Learning Outcomes

* Enhance engineering education by facilitating learning through applied projects in information science.
* Review basics of project development, programming concepts, and fundamentals of data analysis.
* Foster leadership and team work, with division of labor, complementary tasks, discussion and integration.
* Develop the ability to bridge theoretical concepts and practical tasks while dealing with information extraction.
* Master elements of experiential learning: abstract conceptualization, active experimentation, concrete experience, reflective observation.
* Improve transferable engineering skills and the ability to integrate different concepts.
* Promote creativity and critical thinking.
* Refine presentation skills and the ability to conduct and manage projects.

## Additional Objectives

* Techniques to manage data for creating reproducable experiments. _e.g._ You have output data from an experiment, and need to store it in a shareable way that can be coupled with your code to make the experiment reproducable
* Working with and analyzing big data sets (don't fit in your computer's memory)
* Solving optimization problems in Python
* Database management: design, implementation, using SQL or Hardoop, etc.
* Machine/deep learning techniques
