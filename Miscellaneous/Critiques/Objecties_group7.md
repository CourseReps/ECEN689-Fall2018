# Applied Information Science

This multidisciplinary project-based laboratory course provides instruction on extracting information from data through hands-on activities that complement traditional classroom experience.
Topics include predictive modeling, regression and classification; data cleaning and preprocessing; feature engineering and selection; entropy, information theory, and learning.
This course focuses on applications and involves working with real data.
It leverages an array of tools including [Git](http://git-scm.com/), [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/), [Python](https://www.python.org/), [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/), [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/), and [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).
The focus is on modular projects, algorithms and implementation, data management, and visualization.
In addition, emphasis is put on team work, presentation skills, time management, creativity, and innovation.


## Learning Outcomes

* Enhance engineering education by facilitating learning through applied projects in information science.
* Review basics of project development, programming concepts, and fundamentals of data analysis.
  + Improve the skill set of data science project management.
  + Improve the skill set of development operations (DevOps) for data science
* Foster leadership and team work, with division of labor, complementary tasks, discussion and integration.
* Develop the ability to bridge theoretical concepts and practical tasks while dealing with information extraction.
* Master elements of experiential learning: abstract conceptualization, active experimentation, concrete experience, reflective observation.
* Improve transferable engineering skills and the ability to integrate different concepts.
* Promote creativity and critical thinking.
* Refine presentation skills and the ability to conduct and manage projects.
* Apply skills to data sets harvested from projects completed in our coursework, research, or side projects, such as:
  + Data sets collected from a quantum computing project, which compares
    pure adiabatic quantum computing solution with a hybrid adiabatic quantum
    computing and classical QUBO (quadratic unconstrained binary optimization)
    solver to solve the quadratic traveling salesperson (QTSP) problem.
    - We need to process results from the quantum computer simulator, the
      actual quantum computer, and the hybrid solution to the QUBO-based QTSP
      formulation.
      * How to visualize the simulation and experimental data sets
      * How to process the data to improve our QUBO encoding for the QTSP
        problem
