# Applied Information Science

This multidisciplinary project-based laboratory course provides instruction on extracting information from data through hands-on activities that complement traditional classroom experience.
Topics include predictive modeling, regression and classification; data cleaning and preprocessing; feature engineering and selection; entropy, information theory, and learning.
This course focuses on applications and involves working with real data.
It leverages an array of tools including [Git](http://git-scm.com/), [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/), [Python](https://www.python.org/), [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/), [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/), and [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).
The focus is on modular projects, algorithms and implementation, data management, and visualization.
In addition, emphasis is put on team work, presentation skills, time management, creativity, and innovation. 


## Learning Outcomes

* Enhance engineering education by facilitating learning through applied projects in information science.
* Review basics of project development, programming concepts, and fundamentals of data analysis.
* Foster leadership and team work, with division of labor, complementary tasks, discussion and integration.
* Develop the ability to bridge theoretical concepts and practical tasks while dealing with information extraction.
* Master elements of experiential learning: abstract conceptualization, active experimentation, concrete experience, reflective observation.
* Improve transferable engineering skills and the ability to integrate different concepts.
* Promote creativity and critical thinking.
* Refine presentation skills and the ability to conduct and manage projects.

## Critique

* Using different Python libraries (matplotlib, seaborn etc.) for better data visualisation
* Explore the possibility of building an incremental project to get cumulative results on a larger dataset (Kaggle)
* Explore different validation techniques and understand where each succeeds
* Further description about scope and scale of projects, expectations for presentations
* For final presentations, background on the algorithms used along with the rationale will help in getting a broader perspective
* Availability of resources detailing differences and use cases for Python versus R
* Access to learning websites (like Datacamp) for supplemnetal resources
