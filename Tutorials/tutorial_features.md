# Introduction to Feature Engineering
by Anirudh Shaktawat and Kanchan Satpute

Nowadays, Everybody thinks that the better the features they will choose and prepare, the better the results they will achieve for their machine learning model! This is a true statement but at the same time it is a misleading statement. In reality, the results in a machine learning model depend on various factors (as shown in the image).

Then the question is "Why Feature Engineering" !The importance of Feature Engineering is evident in the three statements which are:

#### Better feature means better flexibility
Better features lead to less complex models, Faster to run, Easier to understand and Easier to maintain.
