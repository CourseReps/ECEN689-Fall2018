## WHAT IS EDM?

## WHY DO WE NEED EDM?

1. Assumption of Patterns and Prediction. 
2. Pattern in data -> Predict what comes next -> Relevant action
3. As students work, the system captures their inputs (activities, knowledge, strategy) 
4. Adaptive learning environments - Online learning systems that use data to change in response to student performance.
5. Students benefit from detailed learning data
6. Education community benefits from an interconnected feedback system.

## DATA MINING METHODS - SUPERMARKET SCENARIO:

1. Anomaly Detection: Identification of interesting data. Eg: Customerâ€™s habits of purchasing
2. Association Rule Learning: Searches for relationships between variables. Eg: Which products are frequently bought together
3. Clustering: Discovering groups in similar data. Eg: Seasonal produce/ Organic Fruits
4. Classification: Generalizing known structure to apply to new data. Eg: Which produce are stored in Freezer
5. Regression: Finding a function which models the data to represent the structure. 
6. Summarization: Compact representation of the data set. Eg: Using this Info for Marketing purposes

## EDM IMPLEMENTATION:

1. Decision Tree Analysis - Performance prediction which identify key predictors
2. Time Series Analysis - Predict future behavior based on behavior in the past
3. Cluster Analysis - Group into clusters which describe the shared characteristics of the students in the cluster
4. Sequential Association Analysis - Tracking and analyzing the course; determine if path predicts learner outcome.

## DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM:

It enhances the process of learning by helping stakeholders make decisions. The target is mostly instructor, sometimes students, administrators or researchers.

## CURRENT ISSUE IN EDUCATIONAL DATA MINING:

1. Combining needed data from different systems, which can be difficult.
2. Establishing safeguards for privacy and ethics of data use
3. In terms of Education, making formal education relevant in world  where information is everywhere.
4. Adapting to increasingly diverse learner population online and face-to-face.
