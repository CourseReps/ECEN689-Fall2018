# Introduction to Bokeh
### by Khaled Nakhleh and Kishan Shah
### Course instructor: Jean-Francois Chamberland


Our presentation, presented on September 20th 2018, Introduced the Python packege called *Bokeh*.
Please be aware that we are not *Bokeh* experts, and this presentation is intended to entice students to start experimenting with *Bokeh* on their own time. We hope this presentation will explain the *Bokeh's* basics, importance, and capabilities. 

We should mention that our ideal steup includes a combination of *Bokeh* and *Matplotlib*. Using *Matplotlib* for static graphs (i.e. non-interactive graphs), and *Bokeh* for interactive visuals. Also, if you want to learn *Bokeh*, there will be an unavoidable learning curve to get familiarized with *Bokeh*. However, we believe that once you master *Bokeh*, you will become more efficient with presenting data visually.

### This Tutorial will cover the following:

1. *Bokeh* Breif description
2. Why use *Bokeh* over other packages?
3. *Bokeh* installation
4. Relevance to ECEN 689 course
5. *Bokeh* structure
6. Code examples
7. More reasons for using *Bokeh*
8. Further resources for mastering *Bokeh*
