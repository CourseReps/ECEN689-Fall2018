# Introduction to KERAS

Our presentation, presented on September 23rd 2018, Introduced the [**KERAS**](https://keras.io//) (a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano).

KERAS was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research.

Use Keras if you need a deep learning library that:

Allows for easy and fast prototyping (through user friendliness, modularity, and extensibility).
Supports both convolutional networks and recurrent networks, as well as combinations of the two.
Runs seamlessly on CPU and GPU.

### This Tutorial will cover the following

1. Basics of Neural Network
2. Why use KERAS?
3. Getting Started with KERAS
4. Shortcomings

### 1. Basics of Neural Network

Neural Network derived its name as it functions similar to humar nervous system. Information is given as input in neuron and it processes and gives output. Then there is a feedback system which keeps on correcting the weights to decrease the error in the output.

Basically, there are 3 different layers in a neural network :-

#####  Input Layer

The Input layer is the first layer and only layer which interacts with the features. All the predictors are given as input to this layer and then it passess it on to the further layers to carry out further operations. It directly impacts the output. 

#####  Hidden Layer

The hidden layer is a collection of layers which consist of activation function which decides whether to fire a particular neuron or not. It can be termed as the main processing unit. Main challenge of deep learning is to come up with the proper architecture of hidden layers.

#####  Output Layer

It is the final layer in the network. It is used to trace back the path to input. Based on the output we use back propagation to adjust the weights. Dimension of output depends on the type of problem we are dealing with.

### 2. Why use KERAS

* KERAS prioritizes user experience it is a framework designed for humans
* Keras has broad impact and is very popular in the industry and the research community due to its ease 
* Keras supports various backend engines and does not restrict you to one ecosystem
* Keras has strong GPU support

### 4. Shortcomings
* Understanding of Backend Support
* In built Data Processing tools are not helpful
