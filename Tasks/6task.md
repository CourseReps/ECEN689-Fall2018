# Computational Cloud Resources

Several resources for Machine Learning and Data Science are freely available on the Internet.
This includes [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and Google [Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com), which we will leverage in this course.


## TensorFlow

[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is an open source software library for high performance numerical computation.
It allows easy deployment of computation across a variety of platforms from desktops to clusters of servers.
It comes with strong support for machine learning and deep learning.
